Would you like to win free signed paperback copies of an entire series at once? Do you like reading books and telling other people what you thought about them? Then maybe you're willing to help me out.

When it comes to selling books as an independent author, reviews mean a world of difference. Sadly, people do not often leave reviews for my books. This is something I want to change. As a result, I am running a Review Bounty contest. By leaving an honest and favorable review for my books, you can win **signed print copies** of the **entire series** you're reviewing.


1. Read any of the eligible books listed below
1. Leave an honest but favorable review (at least 4 stars) at the indicated store
1. Send me a link of your review, [using this Google form](http://goo.gl/forms/LGr3QxFiHx)
1. Once the number of reviews for a single book crosses a threshold (see below), I pick one winner from eligible submitted reviews
1. The winner will be contacted and asked to provide a postal address for me to send the books to



I will be handing out print copies whenever the number of reviews for **any single book in one store** equals or exceeds 25, 50, 100, 250 or 500 reviews. Exceptions may apply for books with low review averages, but they'll be stated explicitly for each book.


The following books are eligible for the Review Bounty program:

**The Unbound**
{% include bookcover.html link="/books/repulsion.html" cover="images/covers/cover-6.jpg" name="Repulsion" %}{% include bookcover.html link="/books/benediction.html" cover="images/covers/cover-7.jpg" name="Benediction" %}{% include bookcover.html link="/books/deliverance.html" cover="images/covers/cover-8.jpg" name="Deliverance" %}{% include bookcover.html link="/books/vigilance.html" cover="images/covers/cover-12.jpg" name="Vigilance" %}{% include bookcover.html link="/books/majesty.html" cover="images/covers/cover-10.jpg" name="Majesty" %}{% include bookcover.html link="/books/incursion.html" cover="images/covers/cover-13.jpg" name="Incursion" %}

Winning reviews for any of these books will receive the entire Unbound series (excluding future books that do not have print versions at the time of winning).

Feel free to share this contest with your friends, I can only encourage it. Both [Gift of the Destroyer](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0063UB58W) and [Repulsion](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B017TF4XAQ) should be free in most e-book stores, so entering the review contest for these is easy. 

Happy reading, and I hope to get lots of reviews (and send lots of packages) because of this contest!


**How exactly will you determine the winner?**
I'll let my computer's random number generator pick one of the entries.

**How long do you need my review to be?**
As long as you feel comfortable making it. It has to be original and authentic.

**Do I actually need to read the books?**
YES! I reserve the right to disqualify fake and/or questionable reviews, and I'll be matching the number of reviews to total sales numbers for each book. I repeat: **NO FAKE REVIEWS**. If I wanted those I would have bought them at a fraction of the cost of sending these books.

**Will you announce the winners on your site?**
That's up to the winners. I would prefer naming each winner and thanking them, but I won't name anyone without permission.

**Why does it need to be at least 4 stars?**
Because I can't imagine anyone giving less than 4 stars being glad with print copies. Also: I want to encourage reviews that actually help increase my sales and downloads. Don't get me wrong: you can leave any rating you want. I'm not the sort of writer who lashes out against negative reviews, but I'm not going to give you free books for one.

**Do these signed copies ship worldwide?**
More or less. I live in the Netherlands, and can send signed copies pretty much anywhere our mail service is willing to send them. Considering the size and weight of the packages, I don't expect any issues. If, for any reason, it turns out that I'm not able to send the reward to you, we'll work out something else.

**How many books are you giving away?**
At the current count: 237 books. Further releases will increase this number, and each winner will decrease it.

**Can I win more than once?**
You can only win each set once (there are currently three). But you can enter more than once by reviewing more than 1 book in each series.

**I found a loophole in these rules!**
Awesome, [contact me](https://www.jeroensteenbeeke.nl/contact) and tell me all about it. I'll fix it ASAP. Keep in mind that I reserve the right to modify the rules to prevent abuse.
