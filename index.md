                    A voice that could take control of her. A voice that was only the first glimpse of a world we never knew existed."

            Jeroen Steenbeeke (1983) is a fantasy writer from the Netherlands, and has been creating fantasy stories since the early nineties. Despite several attempts to write novels since then, it wasn't until 2011 that he released his first novel Gift of the Destroyer.

            During the day, Jeroen works as a Software Engineer, creating web applications for schools. In addition to writing he often spends his free time reading, walking, playing DDR, enjoying Scotch, playing video games and working on his Dungeons and Dragons miniatures.

            At night, Jeroen fights aliens, Nazis with superpowers, the Borg, goblins and carnivorous soup.
