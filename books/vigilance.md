For the first time in weeks, I felt normal. Despite the soldiers at our school, despite the creature chasing us halfway across Europe, things seemed like they could be all right again.

And then I collapsed, the bond giving me my powers nearly breaking. If not for my girlfriend Karen's help, I would have lost the connection, and I would have died. But our friend Shannon was already weakened when it happened, and now she's dying.

The only way to safe her is an ancient artifact built by a mad Roman, stored deep underground in an unknown location. We know how to find it, but others do, too. Others that may not be friendly.{% include book.html asin="B01AQPFH2Y" amazonPrint="https://www.amazon.com/Vigilance-Jeroen-Steenbeeke/dp/1326678167/" barnesNoble="http://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/vigilance-jeroen-steenbeeke/1123272061" itunes="https://itunes.apple.com/us/book/id1076214889" kobo="https://store.kobobooks.com/nl-nl/ebook/vigilance-6" luluPrint="http://www.lulu.com/shop/jeroen-steenbeeke/vigilance/paperback/product-22560312.html" %}
