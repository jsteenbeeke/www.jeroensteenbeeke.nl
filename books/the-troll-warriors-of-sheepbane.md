Assuming you are a human being, it is likely that you require sleep, and as a consequence, have experienced dreams before.

I am no different in this regard. Like most people, I often have dreams. But unlike many people, I can clearly recall these dreams, and often remember them down to the tiniest details.

I have a vivid imagination, and I have vivid dreams. In this book you will find out what happens when they collide.
