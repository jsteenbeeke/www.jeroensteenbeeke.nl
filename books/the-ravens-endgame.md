Three decades have passed since Lianna's journey to the north, and the Revenant has never existed. Childbirths are rapidly increasing worldwide, and despite tensions between the various nations, the world seems to have returned to normal.

But those with the Gift of the Seer know differently. From the Northlands to Ktharia, they dream of a vast wall of flame consuming all in sight, leveling mountains and evaporating oceans. In the midst of all this, a young girl wakes up in an alley in Chaedin. She does not know her origins. She does not know her name. But she has the same dream, and she knows that she is the only one who can stop it from happening.{% include book.html asin="B009BTQR4E" amazonPrint="http://www.amazon.com/dp/1300264144/" barnesNoble="http://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/the-ravens-endgame-jeroen-steenbeeke/1113582051" braveNewBooks="http://www.bol.com/nl/p/the-raven-s-endgame/9200000017133098/" itunes="https://itunes.apple.com/nl/book/the-ravens-endgame/id566615051?mt=11" kobo="http://www.kobobooks.com/ebook/The-Ravens-Endgame/book-HFTSyqhFikKi42uHYLD52g/page1.html" luluEpub="http://www.lulu.com/shop/jeroen-steenbeeke/the-ravens-endgame/ebook/product-20395945.html" luluPrint="http://www.lulu.com/content/paperback-book/the-ravens-endgame/13121159" %}
