I should be dead right now. I still don't completely understand what happened, but I ended up back in Dresden, completely healed, and my powers changed. Things were slowly turning back to normal. Karen and I went back to school, and for a few weeks we felt like normal teenagers again. And then the Norse god Freyr showed up at our school.

Representatives from nine supernatural nations&#x2014;the Constantinople Accord&#x2014;are making their way here for a diplomatic gathering. But someone is hunting and killing the representatives, and I may be the only one capable of finding the killer.
