# Never miss a release

By signing up to my mailing list, you will always have the latest information about recent and future book releases, as well as up-to-date information regarding contests and promotions.

<a class="btn btn-large btn-success" href="/mailinglist/subscribe/">Sign up today</a>

## How often will I receive mail?

Not that often. My mailing list tends to be rather quiet, except around book releases. Fewer than once a month, generally.

## What sort of updates will you send?

Primarily updates on upcoming and recently released books

 * Cover reveals
 * Start of a pre-order period
 * E-book release
 * Print availability
 * Announcing winners in the [review bounty](/review-bounty) program

## I want more frequent updates

For more regular updates, you can visit [my blog](/blog), I generally post updates there about once a week. For more minute updates it's probably best to keep an eye on my Twitter feed at [@JSteenbeeke](https://twitter.com/JSteenbeeke).

## What if I no longer want these updates?

When you sign up, you will be given a link to unsubscribe. This link is also included in each mail, as is required by law. Of course, I hope you'll stick around and never require this link.
