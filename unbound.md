    content="I used to think I was a pretty normal teenager: I got up in the morning, went to school, did my homework, played videogames, and dreamed about Karen&#x2014;one of the girls in my class. When I found out she liked me, too, I thought I was the luckiest guy alive. But everything changed when we kissed. Something awakened inside of us, and now we know that we're not normal teenagers after all."  
    content2="For a while I thought these powers were pretty amazing&#x2014;I mean, who wouldn't want superpowers? But it stopped being fun when Karen started hearing a voice in her head. A voice that told her I was her enemy. A voice that could take control of her. A voice that was only the first glimpse of a world we never knew existed."

content="I used to think I was a pretty normal teenager. That was before I found out I could throw people around without a touch. Before I learned I could fly. Before Karen tried to kill me. There were voices inside our heads, and they knew each other. They formed a truce, and then they went silent, leaving us without answers."
content2="Not knowing where else to go, we turned to Paul, who had helped me find Karen when the voice took over. Paul, who the world knew as Cain. But now that we'd found him, something else had found us."

content="I used to think I was a pretty normal teenager, but nothing has been normal about the past week. Superpowers, voices in our heads, a six-thousand-year-old man, a secret NATO organization invading our school and trying to kill us. If only that were the end of the list."
content2="I’ve lost track of Karen in the chaos, and now I’m on the run. Something dark is following me, something that can raise the dead and control the dying. I have one ally in all this&#x2014;Shannon. But while we’re both Sleepers, we may not be on the same side."

{% include book-feature.html title="Book 4: Vigilance" img="/images/covers/cover-12.jpg"
content="For the first time in weeks, I felt normal. Despite the soldiers at our school, despite the creature chasing us halfway across Europe, things seemed like they could be all right again."
content2="And then I collapsed, the bond giving me my powers nearly breaking. If not for my girlfriend Karen's help, I would have lost the connection, and I would have died. But our friend Shannon was already weakened when it happened, and now she's dying."
content3="The only way to safe her is an ancient artifact built by a mad Roman, stored deep underground in an unknown location. We know how to find it, but others do, too. Others that may not be friendly."

content="Telekinesis, golden fire, flight, swords that appear out of thin air, and brilliant white light flowing from my body&#x2014;those things just don't happen to normal teenagers."
content2="All of this started with a battle six thousand years ago, where the archangel Michael was defeated by a creature we now know as Thanatos. A creature who has, after millennia of waiting, taken hold of Michael."
content3="They are hiding somewhere on Earth, gathering strength and waiting. Thousands of his Returner servants are moving across Europe, attacking any supernatural they find along the way. And now they have taken our parents, and we cannot save them on our own."

content="I should be dead right now. I still don't completely understand what happened, but I ended up back in Dresden, completely healed, and my powers changed. Things were slowly turning back to normal. Karen and I went back to school, and for a few weeks we felt like normal teenagers again. And then the Norse god Freyr showed up at our school."
content2="Representatives from nine supernatural nations&#x2014;the Constantinople Accord&#x2014;are making their way here for a diplomatic gathering. But someone is hunting and killing the representatives, and I may be the only one capable of finding the killer."
