**Who are you again?**
My name is Jeroen Steenbeeke. I was born in 1983 and I'm a fantasy writer from the [Netherlands](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eE_IUPInEuc).

**This page looks a bit long, I was kind of expecting an author bio**
There's much more to me than just the author bio, and I figured I'd include some useful tidbits. But if all you want is a short bit of text that describes me as an author, here's what I put in my books:

> Jeroen Steenbeeke (1983) is a fantasy writer from the Netherlands, and has been creating fantasy stories since the early nineties. Despite several attempts to write novels since then, it wasn't until 2011 that he released his first novel [Gift of the Destroyer](https://www.jeroensteenbeeke.nl/book/1/gift-of-the-destroyer/).
> 
> During the day, Jeroen works as a Software Engineer, creating web applications for schools. In addition to writing he often spends his free time reading, walking, playing [DDR](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dance_Dance_Revolution), enjoying [Scotch](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotch_whisky), playing video games and working on his [Dungeons and Dragons](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dungeons_%26_Dragons) miniatures.
> 
> At night, Jeroen fights aliens, the [Borg](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borg_%28Star_Trek%29), [goblins](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labyrinth_%28film%29) and carnivorous soup. You can read all about these dreams in [The Troll Warriors of Sheepbane](https://www.jeroensteenbeeke.nl/book/4/the-troll-warriors-of-sheepbane/).

**Wait, English is not your first language?**
No, my first language is [Dutch](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dutch_language) (which is not the same as [German](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_language). If this confuses you, here's an [explainer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dutch_language#Dutch.2C_not_Deutsch)). I decided I wanted to learn English when I was 8, and learned the basics by watching the original Star Trek on BBC. When people hear me speak they often think I'm Canadian or American. This has been the case since I was 15 at least, when my English teacher Mrs. Admiraal first noticed it.

In addition to Dutch and English, I can speak rudimentary German, and have some basic knowledge of French. I can also speak passable [Twents](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tweants_dialect), which is a Low Saxon dialect common in the east of the Netherlands.

**How on earth do you pronounce your name?**
Unless they've heard the name before, a lot of native English speakers have trouble pronouncing my name, mostly because it follows Dutch spelling conventions.

* Jeroen has two distinct sounds, rather than three, and is pronounced more or less like Yeroon, with a rolling R, and the OO sound is a bit shorter than usual in English.
* Steenbeeke has three distinct sounds, rather than two. The first syllable, Steen is pronounced like Stain. The second syllable, bee, is pronounced like Bay. The final syllable, ke, is pronounced as kuh (or the with a K instead of TH)


In person, I often tell English speakers to call me Jay. It's much easier to get right

**How long have you been writing?**
I've been trying to get a book together since I was nine or ten, but most attempts didn't even get beyond a prologue or first chapter. I did manage to write 7 chapters of really bad fantasy when I was fourteen, and even read part of it aloud during Dutch class (much to the amusement of my fellow students). My next serious attempt wasn't until I started writing Gift of the Destroyer in 2009, but I did write a wide variety of short stories in the mean time, not to mention participating in a few free form roleplaying communities.
