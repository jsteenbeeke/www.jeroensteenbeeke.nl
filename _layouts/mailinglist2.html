			<h4>Can I still opt out after I sign up?</h4>
			Of course! You will receive an opt-out link after you confirm your
			e-mail address, as well as with every additional e-mail you receive.
			And if your e-mail address is not confirmed, you won't need to opt
			out.
			
			<h4>Will you share this information with anyone?</h4>
			My mailing list is powered by <a href="http://mailchimp.com/">MailChimp</a>,
			so the information will be shared with them. Aside from that, your e-mail address or personal information will not be shared.
