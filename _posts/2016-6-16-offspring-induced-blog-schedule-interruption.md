For the past two months (I think?) I've been trying to follow a more rigid blog schedule, to avoid large periods of non-activity. This has been going swell so far, except for the past week. The thing is, last Friday my partner gave birth to our first child: my son Jasper. Both mother and child are doing well, though I'm sorry to say I won't be posting any pictures here.

As you can no doubt understand things have been a bit hectic since then, and following my blogging schedule has been pretty low on the list of priorities, and I have no idea when I'll be able to pick up any semblance of a writing schedule again. Even so, I'm loving it, despite the sleep deprivation.
