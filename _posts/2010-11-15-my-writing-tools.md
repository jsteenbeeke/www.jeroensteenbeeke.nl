In my day-job, I work as a Software Engineer. It should come as no surprise that I feel quite comfortable around computers and technology, and my electricity bill reflects that. I thought it would be interesting to talk about the various &quot;tools&quot; I use for writing. The basics are obvious, I have several small notebooks that contain all sorts of outlines, character descriptions, event summaries and map sketches. But the technological stuff is far more interesting:

**Hardware**

I use an Asus EeePC 900 as my primary writing tool, as I tend to do a lot of writing while traveling by train. The small keyboard takes some getting used to, but I can write with it just fine now. It runs the [Xubuntu](http://www.xubuntu.com) operating system.

In addition to that, I run an [Ubuntu](http://www.ubuntu.com/) server with a [RAID1](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAID1#RAID_1) harddrive setup that hosts a [Mercurial](http://mercurial.selenic.com/) repository, both for backup purposes and for revision control.

**Software**

I often see remarks on blogs and Twitter that people use Microsoft Office for writing. Seeing as I use Linux (and quite frankly, can't stand Office) it shouldn't come as a surprise that I don't follow this trend. The most obvious candidates for Linux would then be [OpenOffice](http://www.openoffice.org/) (or the [LibreOffice](http://www.documentfoundation.org/download/) spinoff) or something along the lines of [Abiword](http://www.abisource.com/), but instead I use [LaTeX](http://www.latex-project.org/) using the [Texmaker](http://www.xm1math.net/texmaker/) editor. LaTeX is a text-based format. The formats used by MS Office as well as the free counterparts are all binary formats, whichï¿½ makes it difficult to use with revision control software. As I mentioned before, I use [Mercurial](http://mercurial.selenic.com/) for revision control and backup purposes. When brainstorming, I use [Freemind](http://freemind.sourceforge.net/) to turn my ideas into nice mind-map like diagrams. Basically all software I use for writing is free and open source.

In addition to this, I am currently working on a small web application so I can put virtual post-it notes on a virtual board, in order to use the [Index Card Method described by Alexandra Sokoloff on her blog](http://thedarksalon.blogspot.com/2008/10/story-structure-101-index-card-method.html).

So, these are my writing tools. What tools do you use?
