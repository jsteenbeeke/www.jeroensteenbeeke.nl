Seeing as I'm skipping Nanowrimo yet again, I figured I'd do something else to keep people entertained. I've already agreed to host a guest post by Tracy Falbe later this month, so I might as well go out and ask a few more people to do guest posts as well. Are there any people in particular you guys think I should ask? And before you start naming all sorts of really famous fantasy authors: please note that my connections are somewhat limited ;-)

In other news: I will probably be switching to a different blog theme sometime in the next month, or perhaps in December. I've already selected a new theme for the site, and I've hired Mike Gauss to create a banner for it (the artist who did the covers for Gift of the Destroyer and The Raven's Endgame).
