Yesterday I read an interesting guest article on the [Guide to Literary Agents Editor's Blog](http://guidetoliteraryagents.com/blog/) in which literary agent Regina Brooks describesï¿½[the publishing process at a glance](http://www.guidetoliteraryagents.com/blog/Agent+Regina+Brooks+On+The+Publishing+Process+At+A+Glance.aspx). According to her 25 step process, I've just completed step 2, which gives me the feeling that I still have a long way to go before my book will be found in print (the fact that many of the steps involve a publisher and an agent but not the author makes it a bit less daunting). But, I've decided not to let this bother me, and proceed with the next step. Which is getting a critique.

So far, parts of [Revenant Rising](https://www.jeroensteenbeeke.nl/2010/11/01/novel-revenant-rising/) have been read by family members. This has given me some valuable feedback, but I've seen enough talent shows to know that family is biased in this regard. If I truly want to improve the story, I need some brutally honest feedback from other sources. Fortunately, I have a few volunteers for that task.

To achieve this critique, I'm going to print a couple of test drafts of the novel using a self-publishing service such as Lulu. I won't actually be doing any self-publishing, just print a few drafts for personal use. I will hand out these copies to my volunteers, who will hopefully have some valuable input on the story. Once this is processed and I have my third draft ready, I'll go agent hunting.
