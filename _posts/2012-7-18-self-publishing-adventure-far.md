People often ask me how my books are doing, and as much as I'd like to answer this question with &quot;great&quot;, that would be lying. Sure, I've sold a few books, and I've received lots of positive feedback, but the truth is that Gift of the Destroyer doesn't get that many sales. The most success I've had was when I participated in KDP Select, where I got a few hundred free downloads and a few sales afterwards.

But you don't have to take my word for it, here are the numbers:

**Ebook sales**

November 2011: 5
December 2011: 0
January 2012: 3
February 2012: 4
March 2012: 2
April 2012: 2
May 2012: 1
June 2012: 0
July 2012: 0 so far

Total: 17 ebooks

**Ebooks given away**

Februari 2012: 231
March 2012: 152
April 2012: 21 (22 if you count [Gareth](https://www.jeroensteenbeeke.nl/unexpected-e-mail/))

Total: 405 ebooks

**Physical sales**
(Excluding gifts)
20 copies

So that brings us to a grand total of 448 copies, which sounds pretty good until you realize only 8% of those were paid for, and half of those have yet to be paid out due to payment thresholds. So to summarize how my self-publishing adventure is going so far, I'd say: nothing exciting happening yet.

A remark I have made on the [Kindle Boards](http://www.kindleboards.com/) recently is: my book is available in 5 stores, and selling in none.

**So, how do I fix this?**

There are a number of possible explanations for my lack of sales. I've more or less ruled out &quot;bad writing&quot; due to the responses I've received so far, especially after the polishing job I did with Gareth's help. I think the most obvious problem is lack of exposure at this point. People simple don't know the book exists, and aren't buying it because of that. Exposure is something I can work on (I intend to do a few giveaways in exchange for reviews), and I also believe that releasing more books can help in this regard (the second Hunter in the Dark book will likely be released in September).

In addition to this, I often wonder if the cover and book pitch are good enough to attract readers. I would like to hear your opinion on this.
