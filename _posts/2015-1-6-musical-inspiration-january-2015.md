First off, to everyone I haven't spoken personally: a happy new year to you!

I noticed the YouTube links on some of my older Musical Inspiration posts have gone dead (mostly due to copyright issues, in many cases the person uploading the music doesn't have the rights to the song in question). My own stance on copyright issues aside, this isn't an ideal situation for me, as it's hard to keep track of what songs I've already posted about. But seeing as I often post about Trance music, I have a good alternative: [Beatport](http://www.beatport.com/), which is a store for electronic music, and they support embedding song fragments. All I needed was to add a custom tag to my BBCode processing library.

Anyway, here are a few new songs I've been listening to lately:
