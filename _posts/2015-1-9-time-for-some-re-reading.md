Last Tuesday I got an e-mail from Amazon that one of my pre-orders had just been delivered. [Firefight](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00LM9SADW/), the latest novel in Brandon Sanderson's Reckoners series, had just been released. Those of you who have been around here for some time will know I was really enthusiastic about [Steelheart](/2013/9/27/thoughts-steelheart.html), the first book in the series, and that I couldn't wait for the sequel.

Well, the sequel is here now, so you've probably guessed that I'm going to start reading it right away.

**Wrong**

The thing about Steelheart is, it's been well over a year since I've read it. In the meantime, Brandon Sanderson released a short story set between Steelheart and Firefight: 

[<img alt="http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51QLRTOS-xL.jpg" src="http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51QLRTOS-xL.jpg" />](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00GQAMAK6/)

Don't get me wrong, I liked this story, but reading it made me realize just how much I'd forgotten about Steelheart. Character names, plot points, locations; a lot of them sounded unfamiliar. I've had this problem a lot recently (with, among others, [Bound, by M.R. Forbes](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00I9T883K/) and [The Broken Eye by Brent Weeks](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00GFHG33A/)), and I think it's a consequence of the sheer volume of books I read.

As such, I figured I'd re-read Steelheart before reading Firefight. I'm enjoying it **a lot**, and I figure it will greatly enhance my enjoyment of Firefight.

**But why stop there?**

I still have about 35 books in my unread folder on my Kindle, but a lot of those I got in bundles and cross-promotions. It's kind of hard to get enthusiastic about reading most of them. On the other hand, there are a lot of series I've read that are still ongoing, and I would love reading again. This will also help as a refresher for when the next parts come out. As such, I've made a list of books I'll be re-reading this year.

1. The Dresden Files (all 15 of them, and I should probably pick up Side Jobs while I'm at it)
2. The Demon Accords, as a refresher before I read John Conroe's latest release
3. The Iron Druid series (if I'm re-reading the other Urban Fantasy books I might as well re-read these, right?)
4. The Mistborn Trilogy and The Alloy of Law

This brings me to a total of... 33 books to re-read and two new ones? Should keep me busy for a while, and I'll probably be reading some other stuff inbetween as well, such as [K.J. Colt](http://kjcolt.com/)'s fourth Healers book.

Are there any books you will be re-reading this year?
