As of I think 10 minutes ago all versions of my book are ready. Last night I submitted the [Kindle edition](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0063UB58W) and during my lunch break I formatted the [Smashwords edition](https://www.smashwords.com/books/view/103111). The last one was especially troublesome since Smashwords only accepts Microsoft Word submissions, and I had a nasty paragraph formatting error that took some time to clear up.

The print version is also ready, but I'm not making that available until I've verified that the proof copy turns out alright.
