Pretty much every decent fantasy book I've ever read has included a map of some sort (the exception being Urban Fantasy of course). Seeing as I consider my own work to be at least &quot;decent&quot; as well, I knew I had to include a map of the world events happen in at some point. Thanks to[ an awesome tutorial by RobA at the Cartographer's Guild](http://www.cartographersguild.com/showthread.php?1142-Award-Winner-Using-GIMP-to-Create-an-Artistic-Regional-RPG-Map) and several hours spent with [GIMP](http://www.gimp.org/), I have created a somewhat acceptable world map to share with you.
