The last few weeks have been very busy for me, mostly due to things that have not been book-related. As a result, I haven't given this blog much thought, even though I could have reported a number of things over the past few weeks. Hopefully I'll get to writing blog posts more often in the coming weeks, but I can't make any promises. That said, I have a number of things to share.

**Sales update**
A while ago, I wrote that I had decided to enroll Gift of the Destroyer in Amazon's KDP Select program., in an effort to increase the exposure of my books through free promotions. The first free promotion has in fact already happened, on the 9th and 10th of May. During these two days, Gift of the Destroyer was featured on a number of websites, and I was quite surprised by the number of downloads: **2444**.

As a result of this promotion, sales of both Gift of the Destroyer and The Raven's Endgame spiked, making May my best month in sales so far. Mind you, with 32 sales I won't be breaking into any bestseller lists, but if you consider that 9 sales a month was my previous record, I have every reason to be satisfied.

I will be running another (longer) promotion by the end of July, and promoting the book on a larger number of sites.

**Hunter's Chosen**A lot has happened with regard to the third part of my Hunter in the Dark trilogy. The book has been edited by [Ashley Davis](http://ashleydaviseditor.com/), and I hope to finish processing her feedback by the end of the week. After that, my beta readers will give it a final read-through, which would enable me to release the book by the end of July or the beginning of August. I'm hesitant to give a tentative release date, mostly due to the delays I've had already. It would be nice to let the release coincide with the free promo for Gift of the Destroyer, but I have no idea if I can pull this off.

**Future plans**I'm about halfway done with the first draft of The Troll Warriors of Sheepbane, which is a small book describing a number of bizarre dreams I have had. Seeing as this book is rather small compared to my works of fiction, finishing this shouldn't take that long. I already have a few volunteers to proofread it, so depending on who I hire to edit it (and how long he or she needs), this release shouldn't be that long after Hunter's Chosen. After that, I'm going to work on my next series of books (a series of Urban Fantasy novellas, most likely).
