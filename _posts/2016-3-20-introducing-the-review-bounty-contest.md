When was the last time you've written a review about a book you liked? Think about it for a moment. For me it was July last year, a week or so after K.J. Colt released [Forsaken Power](http://www.amazon.com/Forsaken-Power-Healers-Meligna-Book-ebook/dp/B010RUSITC), but despite having read dozens of books since then, I haven't left a review for any of them.

I have a valid excuse: Amazon frowns upon authors leaving reviews on other authors' books, so I tend to keep it to a minimum, and only leave positive reviews to avoid any impression of conflict of interest. But I don't think this is the reason the average reader is hesitant to leave reviews, if it crosses their mind at all.

Even so, it is my opinion that my own books simply do not have enough reviews. I want more of them, I want your help, and I'm prepared to offer something in return. I'm going to be giving away signed copies of my books to a number of lucky reviewers.

The rules are simple: leave a review on one of my books, send me a link to the review, and you become eligible to win the entire series as signed paperbacks.
