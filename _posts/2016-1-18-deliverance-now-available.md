*I used to think I was a pretty normal teenager, but nothing has been normal about the past week. Superpowers, voices in our heads, a six-thousand-year-old man, a secret NATO organization invading our school and trying to kill us. If only that were the end of the list.*

*I’ve lost track of Karen in the chaos, and now I’m on the run. Something dark is following me, something that can raise the dead and control the dying. I have one ally in all this&#x2014;Shannon. But while we’re both Sleepers, we may not be on the same side.*
