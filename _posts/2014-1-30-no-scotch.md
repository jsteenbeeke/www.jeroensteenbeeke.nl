The last few days, a number of suspicious looking messages appeared on my Twitter stream:

I want to clear up a few things here, before people start getting wrong ideas about me.

1. I am generally (as in 99% of the time) sober when I write
1. When I do drink, it's almost always during the weekend (you'll notice the first tweet was on a Friday evening)
1. I only drink 1 or 2 glasses of Scotch on an average evening. This limits the impact on my writing ability and prevents hangovers


All of these tweets were written with humorous intent, and pretty much everyone interpreted them as such. But I want it made very clear that I do not take the consumption of alcohol lightly. I am not a heavy drinker, and am acutely aware of the dangers of alcoholism. I don't drink to get drunk, but to enjoy the beverage in question.

And just so we're clear, I'm well beyond the legal drinking age.



Beer has never really been my thing, mostly because I don't find lagers (the most common beer around here) all that special. I do enjoy wheat beer from time to time, and a good glass of [Gulpener Korenwolf](http://www.gulpener.nl/de-bieren/korenwolf/) (a Dutch witbier) or [Erdinger Weissbru](http://www.erdinger.de/) (a German Weizenbier) I will definitely enjoy. Sometimes, I will also enjoy a good Belgian beer (of which there are many variations), [Tripel Karmeliet](http://www.bestbelgianspecialbeers.be/main_nl.html) foremost among them.

As for another common drink, wine, I never really got into that. I know a few people who can get really excited about it, and receive boxes full of wine bottles on a weekly basis, but it's not for me.

Over the past few years I've gradually been trying drinks with higher alcohol percentages. I quickly found I enjoyed drinks such as [Baileys](http://www.baileys.com/), and through happenstance I also tried a few stronger drinks such as vodka (which I found a bit too bland) and aquavit (which was far too heavy on the herbs and spices). During a vacation in Ireland I tried Jameson, which was pretty good, but a couple of fellow travelers (and later, a few co-workers) said that they found Scotch to be far more interesting. A couple of Johnnie Walker blends ([Red](http://www.johnniewalker.com/en-US/redlabel/) and then [Black Label](http://www.johnniewalker.com/en-US/blacklabel/)) later, I tried my first single malt ([Caol Ila 12 year old](http://www.malts.com/index.php/en_row/Our-Whiskies/Caol-Ila)), and I've been eagerly exploring new brands ever since.
