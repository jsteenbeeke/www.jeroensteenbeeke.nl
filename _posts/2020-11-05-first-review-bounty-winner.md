This morning I found out that my novel [Gift of the Destroyer](/books/gift-of-the-destroyer.html) 
had finally received [50 reviews](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0063UB58W) on the US Amazon Store.

As promised on the [review bounty](/review-bounty) page, I have selected a winner to receive a free
set of signed copies of the entire Hunter in the Dark series, namely **Alan**. Thank you for
your honest review, and I hope you enjoy your copies. 

With 50 reviews received, the next milestone for Gift of the Destroyer is now 100 reviews.
