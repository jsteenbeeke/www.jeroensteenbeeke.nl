About two weeks ago, I dropped my [Kindle Keyboard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Kindle#Kindle_Keyboard) when I wanted to put it on my nightstand. This wasn't the first time this has happened, but each time it happened before, it made a better landing. This time, I was not so fortunate. It hit the ground at the side, causing the e-ink screen to crack and killing 90% of all pixels in the top-left corner.

As you will undoubtedly understand, this makes reading the start of each page somewhat of a challenge. It didn't bother me that much for the first day or so, but it didn't take long for me to decide I needed a replacement.

So I went ahead and bought a [Kindle Oasis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Kindle#Kindle_Oasis). It's the most expensive Kindle model currently available, but seeing as I was rather fond of the paging buttons on the Kindle Keyboard, I figured this was a must-have feature for me. In addition, the Oasis is extremely fast compared to the Keyboard, and even though I've barely scratched the surface I think I made a good decision in buying this.

My Kindle Keyboard served me well for over 5 years. I'm hoping the Oasis will give me a similar experience.
