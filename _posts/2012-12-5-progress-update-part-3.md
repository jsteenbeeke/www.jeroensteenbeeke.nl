As some of you know, I've started working on the final part of the Hunter in the Dark trilogy several weeks ago. Today I am happy to report that I have reached 27% completion on the first draft.

After those drafts, I still send the book to my Alpha Readers, which usually leads to more edits. Once those are done, I send the book off to the editor, who takes care of pretty much every linguistic imperfection there is, and eliminates any lingering plot holes. Once her feedback has been processed, the book proceeds to the Beta Readers, who try to take out any remaining typos and errors. So, in reality, 27% on the first draft is not 27% done of the total book. Closer to half, really.

Even so, I'm still glad I made it this far in such a short time.

In other news, I'll be participating in a group promotion called [Winter Escapes](http://yafantasybooks.com) starting this Friday.

On Sunday I'll be doing a blog post on the promotion website as well, showing you how my characters Sarina and Brenor experienced winter in the Revenant's timeline. I
