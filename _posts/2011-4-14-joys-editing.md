It's been a while since I've read &quot;[your first draft is always going to suck](http://thedarksalon.blogspot.com/2009/03/your-first-draft-is-always-going-to.html)&quot; by Alexandra Sokoloff, but I think it partially holds true for any draft you haven't given a detailed look in a while. I recently started another round of edits for [Revenant Rising](https://www.jeroensteenbeeke.nl/novel-revenant-rising/), and suddenly it struck me: this was complete crap! There was so much wrong with this draft, how could I possibly get this into a workable book?

Of course, I've been through this before. I can't deny that I still have quite a bit of work to do before I can release my novel. But it is by no means an unsalvagable wreck. I've received enough praise from beta readers to feel confident about the story.

But that does not take away that editing my work is an interesting process. Despite this being my third round of edits, I keep finding sentences and turns of phrase that don't quite work, and wonder why I left them intact in the first place.

Still, it's good to work on my books again.
