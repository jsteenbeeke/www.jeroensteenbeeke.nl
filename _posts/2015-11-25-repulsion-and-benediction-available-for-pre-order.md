If you're subscribed to my [mailing list](https://www.jeroensteenbeeke.nl/mailinglist/), you should already have received this announcement a week ago. But in case you missed it: I've gone ahead and uploaded the first two books in the Unbound series to various ebook distributors for pre-order.

Both books will be released on the **28th of December**, but you can reserve your copy right now! Just click on the store of your choice and you'll be taken to the pre-order page. In addition to these vendors, both books will also be available through Oyster, Scribd and Tolino on the official release date. Don't have an e-reader but still want to get a copy? I am also working on print versions, and I'll send out an announcement as soon as they become available.
