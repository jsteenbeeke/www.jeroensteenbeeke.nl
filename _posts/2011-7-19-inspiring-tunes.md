A while ago [I shared a number of songs](https://www.jeroensteenbeeke.nl/musical-inspiration/) that help me focus, both when working and when writing. There are plenty of other songs I regularly listen to, so I thought I'd share a few more:

{% include youtube.html video="ceijig-z9tg" %}

{% include youtube.html video="v26T8RbQZFQ" %}

{% include youtube.html video="WpTdxzeQPvU" %}

I usually just put the four of these together in a playlist and play them at random. These songs really help me relax and stimulate my imagination. Vocal Trance songs usually evoke a feeling of &quot;magic&quot;, and work well for inspiring wondrous or extraordinary events in stories.

These songs evoke a feeling of adventure, despite being very different types of music. There are a lot of Future World Music songs that have this effect on me, but I didn't quite expect 30 Seconds to Mars to have a similar effect.

So, what sort of music inspires you? And how?
