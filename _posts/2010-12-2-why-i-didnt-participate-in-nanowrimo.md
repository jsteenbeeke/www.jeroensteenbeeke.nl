I find [NaNoWriMo](http://www.nanowrimo.org/) to be an interesting concept. For those of you who are not familiar with the concept: the goal is to write a novel of at least 50K words during the month November. There are some rules of course, but the basic concept is simple. 50,000 words in 30 days, so an average of 1667 words each day to make it to the finish line. This seems a rather daunting task, but many people do make the finish line. So, is that why I did not participate, did I feel I was not up to the challenge? No.

The truth is far simpler: I didn't find out what NaNoWriMo was until the 11th of November. This, of course, wasn't the only reason, but with only 19 days to go that means I would have to write 2632 words each day, further complicating an already daunting task. I had had no time to prepare, so any story I was going to write would have to be done from scratch. I had several ideas of course, but without an outline I knew I would hit a wall before reaching the mark.

But even if none of those things had been an issue, I still wouldn't have made the finish line. A lot of things have happened in November. I moved to a new apartment, finished the second draft of Revenant Rising, and have generally been extremely busy. But, as J.D. Robinson said in response to my comments on her blog: [cpage=1#comment-6]there's always next year](http://jdwrites.com/?p=98[#amp).
