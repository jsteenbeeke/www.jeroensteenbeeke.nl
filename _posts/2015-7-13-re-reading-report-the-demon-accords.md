[Back in January](/2015/1/9/time-for-some-re-reading.html) I said I would spend the start of this year doing some re-reading of old books. This project is still ongoing, and the total number of books re-read now stands at 30, not including new releases in series I've re-read. I still have 10 more books on my list, so I will probably remain busy for the foreseeable future.

Anyway, I've finished re-reading two series since my post about the Dresden Files, and today I'll be talking about [the Demon Accords](http://www.johnconroe.com/BOOKS.html). I stumbled upon this series after finishing the [Iron Druid series by Kevin Hearne](https://kevinhearne.com/novels) (which I'm currently re-reading), when Amazon suggested I might like it.

The short version: I did like it, also on second read.
The long version: These books have some issues.

The Demon Accords have three problems that may or may not impact your enjoyment of the series:

1. The protagonists are grossly overpowered, and it isn't until Forced Ascent (the 7th book?) that they face enemies that could realistically be considered their equals. The books that feature Declan as the protagonist are better in this regard, but not by much.
2. The author tries to explain a lot of supernatural stuff with regular physics, but not in a way that will convince anyone with even a moderate understanding of high school physics
3. There are some quality issues with the e-books, including spelling errors, formatting errors, and in one case: a track changes strikethrough that made it into the final ebook.

That said, I did consider these books to be entertaining.
