In a few months, I will be releasing the third and final part of the Hunter in the Dark trilogy. I've been working on this trilogy since 2009, with the first book [Gift of the Destroyer](https://www.jeroensteenbeeke.nl/gift-destroyer/) released in November 2011, and the second book [The Raven's Endgame](https://www.jeroensteenbeeke.nl/ravens-endgame/) released in September 2012. I've been working on this trilogy for four years now, and with the release of the final book, it will finally be completed.

Last Friday, I revealed the cover for the final book to my [mailing list](http://promo.jeroensteenbeeke.nl/), and now I am happy to share it with the rest of you.

The cover art was done by [Michael Gauss](http://www.helmuttt.deviantart.com/), who also did the covers for the first two books. I expect to release Hunter's Chosen sometime this summer, but I cannot give an exact date as it depends on the speed of my alpha and beta readers, as well as the availability of my regular editor. I will keep you posted of course, and I hope you will all buy Hunter's Chosen when it comes out.
