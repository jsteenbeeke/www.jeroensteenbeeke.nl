I think I may have to postpone the publication of Revenant Rising. There are a number of reasons for this, but the primary reason is that my current round of edits is turning into a rather substantial rewrite of the story. I've already completely redone the first chapter, and I'm sure there are many parts further in the story that would benefit from further rewrites. One particular subplot is turning out to be more of a hindrance than a benefit to the story, so I'll either substantially alter it or cut it entirely.

I've already done quite a few rewrites of my story's villain, giving him more credible motivations and further enhancing his back story, but I'm still not sure he's quite right. The first drafts portrayed him as a sort of comic book villain, while my current draft makes him more of a tragic villain looking for vengeance. It's still not quite right, it's as if I made him too human. I'm not sure what to do about this yet.

Also, I'm making an effort to reduce the amount of brooding my main character does. A lot of her personal conflicts are internalized rather than expressed through dialogue or other visible actions. Additionally, while most of my characters are adequately described, some beta readers remarked they had trouble picturing her. This too will need to be changed.

Once these changes are made, I might even make another proofreading draft. Seeing as I am not hiring an editor, it's probably better to be safe than sorry.
