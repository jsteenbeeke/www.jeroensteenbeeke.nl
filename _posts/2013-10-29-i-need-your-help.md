In my previous blog post I said I was considering making Gift of the Destroyer permanently free. For this to work, I first needed to get out of Amazon's KDP Select program, which meant waiting until the 27th of October (i.e. last Sunday). Now that Gift of the Destroyer is out of KDP Select, I've uploaded [Gift of the Destroyer to Kobo books](http://store.kobobooks.com/en-US/ebook/gift-of-the-destroyer), setting the price to $0.

To get Amazon to also offer it for free, I need your help. Please keep in mind that you need an Amazon account to make this work:
1. Head over to Gift of the Destroyer's Amazon page at [http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0063UB58W](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0063UB58W/) (and if you're feeling generous, the UK page at [http://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B0063UB58W](http://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B0063UB58W))
1. If the listed price is already $0 (or ï¿½0), skip to step 8. If not: Scroll down a bit and click &lt;b&gt;tell us about a lower price&lt;/b&gt;
1. Select &quot;Website (Online)&quot;
1. Enter the Kobo URL: [http://store.kobobooks.com/en-US/ebook/gift-of-the-destroyer](http://store.kobobooks.com/en-US/ebook/gift-of-the-destroyer)
1. Enter 0 for both the book and shipping
1. Enter today for the date
1. Click &quot;Submit Feedback&quot;
1. If you haven't done so already, grab a free copy of Gift of the Destroyer from Kobo (or Amazon, if it's already gone free)

Thanks!
