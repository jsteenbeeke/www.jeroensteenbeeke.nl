I've mentioned this on Twitter a couple of times, but I've been spending way too much time between writing projects lately. The main culprit for this delay has been the site you are looking at right now, with a vacation to Alaska also being a significant factor.

Now that I've started writing again (working on [book 8](/2014/1/22/note-current-projects.html)), I'm noticing that my speed isn't exactly up to par. On the one hand this isn't all that strange, since I haven't been writing much since I finished the first draft of [book 7](/2014/1/22/note-current-projects.html), aside from a small writing experiment without an outline. But another reason is that I've not been using the same speed boosting techniques I used when writing book 7.

A while ago someone suggested the book [2k to 10k: Writing Faster, Writing Better, and Writing More of What You Love](http://www.amazon.com/2k-10k-Writing-Faster-Better-ebook/dp/B009NKXAWS) to me, and I've found it incredibly useful in increasing my writing output. I've created a number of tools to help in this regard, most importantly a better word count tracker for my own funky writing setup, with built-in database. These work great, **if you're actually using them**.

Yeah... erm... for the first two days I completely forgot that I had these tools. Oops! So yeah, now that I'm using them again, I'm actually making progress again.
