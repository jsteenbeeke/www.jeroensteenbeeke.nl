Regular readers know that I often find inspiration for my stories in music. In most cases, this is either Trance music, or Celtic folk music, with the occasional Emma Hewitt song thrown into the mix. But another &quot;genre&quot; I listen to when writing is video game music (and, considering the diversity, the word genre is in quotes).

These songs often evoke memories and feelings I felt when playing these video games, and I would like to share them with you:

And in addition to the original versions of these, there are a number of really awesome remixes of video game songs:

Finally, I'd like to point out an album by independent artist Fredrik Miller, which is filled with remixes of music from (relatively) well-known video games:
