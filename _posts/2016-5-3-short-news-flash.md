A number of things to share:

* Had a great time at [De Dondersteen](http://www.de-dondersteen.nl/) to discuss a [cameo appearance](/2016/4/19/the-cameo-appearance.html) by the owner Sebastiaan in Incursion
* First editing pass of [Incursion](/2016/3/24/incursion-and-the-road-ahead.html) is complete. Two more to go until I send it to my alpha readers

<!--more-->* No entries for the [Review Bounty](https://www.jeroensteenbeeke.nl/review-bounty/) program yet. This is a bit disappointing
* The contact form has been repaired. It now uses [MailGun](http://www.mailgun.com/) (by RackSpace) as its e-mail delivery platform
* My new blogging schedule is working out so far, and I've managed to maintain two posts per week with relative ease
* Outline for standalone post-apocalyptic young adult story at 25%


That is all
