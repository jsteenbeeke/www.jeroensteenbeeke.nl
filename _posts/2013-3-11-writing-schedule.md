In my previous post I said I would be keeping my current writing schedule for the current novel, and instituting a more flexible one for my next novel.

Ahem, yeah, right. After making only 3% progress in the previous week (mostly due to illness and general exhaustion), I'm throwing the current schedule out, and instituting a new schedule that's more flexible. This way, I can keep writing at a pace that is still fast (i.e. gets the book done in a reasonable amount of time), while at the same time giving me some breathing space.

So, without further ado, the new schedule:
| Deadline | Required Progress |
| --- | --- |
| March 15 | 82% |
| March 22 | 88% |
| March 29 | 94% |
| April 5 | 100% |

Now, I'm not exactly sure if the book will actually be *done* on the 5th of April. I'll definitely have reached my target word count by then, but by all indications I'm going to surpass the word count, making this book longer than either Gift of the Destroyer or The Raven's Endgame (though not by that much).

Either way, wish me luck!

In other news, I will be testing a new mailing list system this week, which'll probably go online next week. I'll probably post a more detailed discussion about this system in a later post.
