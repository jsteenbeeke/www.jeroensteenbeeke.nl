As part of my ongoing efforts of [re-reading all the things](/2015/1/9/time-for-some-re-reading.html), and in part because [K.J. Colt](http://kjcolt.com/) was really eager to hear my input about her latest book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B010RUSITC">Forsaken Power</a>, I have recently re-read the entire Healers of Meligna series:

I got introduced to this series 2 years ago through [KBoards](http://www.kboards.com/), where I occasionally hang out. The author was looking for beta readers for Blood Sacrifice, and since I had just finished reading... something (not sure what) I volunteered. Seeing as it's a bit hard to proofread something you don't know the history of I bought the first two books, and finished them in like 3 days.

Anyway, here is are my re-reading observations. Here be spoilers:

* Concealed Power does a really good job of describing a peaceful village, bringing it to life in a way few authors manage (the only better example I can think of is <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00HBQUF8S">Fool's Assassin by Robin Hobb</a>)
* Blood Healing is still my favorite book in this series, until the end, Adenine isn't really in control, which increases tension
* Forsaken Power was hard to read for me, mostly because I had already beta-read the first half, and most of it wasn't new. I was glad to find out that all the issues I pointed out had been fixed. Once I got past this initial part, the story got really interesting again, and I'm very eager to find out where the series will go next.
* Did I mention I hate cliffhanger endings?


In my opinion, the Healers of Meligna is an example of self-publishing done right. Formatting errors are non-existent, the story is compelling, and while I did find a typo here and there, the amount is comparable to the average book (traditionally published or otherwise), and I would recommend this book to anyone who loves fantasy and is interested in something non-standard.

I do want to post a caveat, however. The subject matter is probably not suitable for anyone who has been the victim of sexual abuse, so if that is the case, then I would rather recommend reading something else.
