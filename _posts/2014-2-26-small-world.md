I often discuss books with my co-workers, as many of them are avid fantasy or science fiction readers. Their tastes vary, as do their preferences for reading mediums. We have people who insist on using paper books, a few die-hard e-book fanatics (myself included) and at least one guy who only listens to audiobooks.

But a few months back, an interesting conversationï¿½ happened with a co-worker who shall remain anonymous:

**Co-worker:** Hey Jeroen, have you ever read the In Her Name series?
**Me:** That doesn't ring any bells, can you send me a link
**Co-worker:** Sure *sends Kindle link*
**Me:** All right, sounds interesting. *Sees [author photo](http://www.amazon.com/Michael-R.-Hicks/e/B002BMIC96/)* Hey, that guy looks familiar.

I've mentioned many times that I'm semi-active on KBoards, and as it turns out, Michael R. Hicks (the author of In Her Name) frequents that forum as well, and then I started noticing his name popping up in other places as well. A number of people I know through Twitter were following him as well (which isn't such a surprise, the guy has 80K+ followers). Anyway, that got me thinking: gee, small world.

(For those of you wondering, I've briefly mentioned [my thoughts about those books](https://www.jeroensteenbeeke.nl/combat-space/) in an earlier post - even shorter summary: I liked them).

Last week, that same co-worker started the following conversation.

**Co-worker:** Hey Jeroen, I've got another suggestion for you! *Sends link to [Union of Renegades](http://www.amazon.com/Union-Renegades-Rys-Chronicles-Book-ebook/dp/B003UES7U8/)*
**Jeroen**: Wait a minute, I've heard about that before, isn't that a book by Tracy Falbe?
**Co-worker**: You've read it?
**Jeroen**: No I've only read the prequel series, but Tracy did [a promotional guest post on my blog in 2012](https://www.jeroensteenbeeke.nl/guest-post-tracy-falbe-profile-cruce-chenomet/).

Another good suggestion by said co-worker. I've only just started reading the book, but the story definitely has me interested. Tracy's writing style can take some getting used to (she does a lot of head-hopping), but once you've done that the stories are quite interesting.

But again, it struck me how small this world is. I've often had books suggested to me by authors I'd never heard of, but apparently this particular co-worker reads a lot of the same books I do (another example is Patrick Rothfuss' Kingkiller series, which he finished before I did), and manages to run into a lot of indie authors I know. I really wonder what he'll come up with next.

On a side note: my &quot;to read&quot; list is getting a bit out of hand.
