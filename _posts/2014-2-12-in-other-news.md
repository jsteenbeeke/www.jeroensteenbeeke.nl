Just a few minor bits of news:
* Progress on book 6 has suffered a minor setback as I cut two chapters of backstory info-dump
* I've found a new cover artist for my upcoming five book Urban Fantasy series. I'll post more details once the covers are done.

<!--more-->* All EPUB editions of all my books have been updated, mostly to get the forced page breaks between chapters fixed. The iBook and Barnes and Noble versions may take a few weeks to update, however.

That is all.
