Music plays a huge role in shaping the stories I write, and more often than not, I find that music released by Armada Music (the production company co-created by my countryman Armin van Buuren) to be prominent among the songs I listen to (and yes, Emma Hewitt is also signed to Armada Music):

As such, here are a number of songs published by Armada Music that I listen to while writing.

And yes, one of them is performed by Emma Hewitt. Sorry :-P
