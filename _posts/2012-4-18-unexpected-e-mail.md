I'm not quite sure where to begin this post, as my mind's still racing because of the whole situation.ï¿½ Here's the thing: I am currently going through a 21 page document describing typos, grammatical glitches, and style issues with Gift of the Destroyer. This document was made by a man named Gareth, who contacted me on Twitter yesterday, asking if he could get my e-mail address for a question regarding my book.

I've never had any questions about my books from strangers, so I was extremely curious. I sent Gareth a direct message with my e-mail address, and patiently waited for him to e-mail me. To be honest I expected a question with regard to the book's plot, or some other question with regard to how I write books.

My guesses were of course wrong. The gist of the e-mail was that Gareth was interested in Gift of the Destroyer, but he did not own a Kindle. Ordering a print copy from Lulu was not convenient either, so instead he offered a trade, which I can paraphrase as: he would fix the many typos and other errors in exchange for a free copy.

**Wait, what?**

At this point in the e-mail I think my heart skipped a beat. If there's one thing I don't want it's to fall into the stereotype of &quot;indie reader who publishes without editing&quot;, which is why I let dozens of people proofread the novel to check for errors. Many were of course found, but it seemed &quot;the few that slipped by&quot; were in fact &quot;a lot that slipped by&quot;. So after I read Gareth's offer my brain did this:

Having handed out hundreds of free copies as part of Amazon's KDP select program, this really was a no-brainer. Getting a free proofread in exchange for a free copy? **Hell yes!**. So yesterday I took the latest edition of Gift of the Destroyer, created a fresh PDF version, and e-mailed it over, saying I accepted the offer. I expected at least a week would pass before Gareth got back to me. So you can probably imagine my surprise when he finished it in a day and sent me the aforementioned document earlier today.

I expect I'll be releasing a new version of Gift of the Destroyer in a few days, with many fixes and a new thank you in the acknowledgements.
