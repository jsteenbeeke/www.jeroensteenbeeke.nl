**In a world where childbirths are becoming increasingly rare, Lianna, a  young pregnant woman becomes entangled in a stranger's quest to prevent  an apocalypse he has already lived through. Pursued by a man who feeds on the life of others, the only way to reach their goal is through a land none have survived for a thousand years.**

<!--more-->**** Warning: the next fragment contains spoilers ****
For the past fifty years, the number of childbirths has been steadily  declining in the village of Rennick. When Lianna unexpectedly becomes  pregnant by the son of the local blacksmith, Dreyan, this causes a bit of a stir among those involved with the discovery. The arrival of a pair of strangers further complicates matters. An encounter between Lianna  and the first stranger, Brenor, reveals that Lianna has the Gift of the  Destroyer and can command the elements of nature. Brenor is wounded, and being hunted by the second stranger, a man named Skayd who feeds off the life force of others. When Skayd kills Dreyan after he refuses to  tell the location of Brenor, Lianna decides to flee Rennick together  with Brenor, only to learn he intends to venture into the Forbidden Lands, a stretch of land from which no man has returned for a thousand  years.

With the promise of helping her master her Destroyer gift, they enter  the Forbidden Lands with Skayd in close pursuit. Their goal is to find a  man in the Forbidden Lands with whom Brenor has a score to settle.  Initially believing his goal to simply be revenge for a lost love,  Lianna learns the truth about Brenor through a prophetic dream: Brenor  has already seen the entire world die because of this man, who will one day be known as the Revenant, and only  through the sacrifice of the world's most powerful Destroyer has he been  able to travel back in time to stop him.

As Lianna slowly comes to terms with the loss of her loved one and the fact that her child will grow up without her father, she must face the dangers of the  Forbidden Lands while evading the merciless hunter Skayd to prevent the future Brenor has already lived through.
