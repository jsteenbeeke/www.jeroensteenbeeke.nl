With all the [fun](/2016/7/17/why-not-to-mail-5000-people-out-of-the-blue.html) happening [with my mailing list](/2016/7/15/a-case-of-subscriber-limits.html) lately, it's good to be able to take my mind off things. Today is the first day back on the day job after the [birth of my son](/2016/6/16/offspring-induced-blog-schedule-interruption.html), and seeing as the weather was quite beautiful, I decided to go to work by bicycle.

My commute normally takes about 25 minutes (8 minutes by bicycle, followed by 15 minutes by train, followed by 3 minutes on foot), but whenever the weather is good (that is, no rain and low wind), I often choose to do the full 14 kilometer by bicycle.

Today was no exception, and for once I didn't forget to bring my iPod. The warm weather combined with a number of songs I hadn't heard in a while made it quite a pleasant trip. A small selection of music I listened to on the way:
