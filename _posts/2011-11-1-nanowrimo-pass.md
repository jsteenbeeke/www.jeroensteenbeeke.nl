As of today, Nanowrimo has officially started. Writers around the world are now hammering away at their manuscripts in order to reach the 50000 word goal. I wish them all the best, but once again I will pass. I am simply too busy with existing projects to have enough time to write 1.6K words each day (especially since one of those projects is Revenant Rising, and another is its sequel).
