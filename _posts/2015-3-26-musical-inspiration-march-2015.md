[Beatport](http://pro.beatport.com) recently updated their website, moving their store to the [pro.beatport.com](http://pro.beatport.com/) subdomain. One of the side-effects of this move was that [Beatport widgets would no longer work](/2015/3/10/please-dont-stop-the-music.html), since the embed function redirected to regular HTTP. As a result, I could no longer post Beatport music snippets, and I decided to postpone Musical Inspiration posts for the time being.

But when I checked the February post today, I noticed they were working again. So without further ado, here are a few more songs I listen to while writing, most of them recent purchases:
