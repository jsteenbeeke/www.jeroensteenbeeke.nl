This post is a refer-back-later post, which I can show to recruiters when they [send me a contact invite on LinkedIn](https://www.jeroensteenbeeke.nl/kind-headhunters/). This is to save both them and me some time.

**R: Please connect with me on LinkedIn**!

<!--more-->J: You didn't read my profile, did you?

**R: You can't expect me to read all that!**J: That's your job, isn't it?

**R: But it's really long**
J: The first sentence would have been enough.

**R: You're an arrogant piece of #$@$ aren't you?**J: My profile also says &quot;Writer&quot;, are you really surprised that I look down on people who don't read?

**R: Okay okay, I'm sorry. But really, can I interest you in a new job?**
J: No

**R: Why not?**
J: I like my current job

**R: Really? But why did you spend so much time on your profile if you're not looking for a new job?**J: Because I want it to be an accurate representation, and I hate leaving things unfinished

**R: But surely there must be things about your current job that need improvement?**J: If there are, they're only minor issues, and no reason to switch employers.

**R: Surely you're looking for a new challenge?**
J: Translation: &quot;I have no idea what it is you do&quot;

**R: Corporate culture, then?**J: Translation: &quot;I have no idea where you work either&quot;

**R: Travel time?**
J: Is exactly right at my current job.

**R: Better salary?**
J: Does it have 7 digits?

**R: Better hours?**
J: Tell you what, if you find a company willing to pay a 7-digit salary for a 16 to 24-hour work week, then we'll talk.

**R: No really, what do I need to do to make you consider quitting your current job?**J: Buy 3000 copies of my books on a monthly basis for the next 60 years or so.
