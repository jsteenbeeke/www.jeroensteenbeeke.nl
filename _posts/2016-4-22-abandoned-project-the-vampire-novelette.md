A while ago, I think it was between writing [Benediction](/books/benediction.html) and [Deliverance](/books/deliverance.html), I was working on a side project that involved vampires. I think it was due to disappointment with recent vampire fiction that I started this project, and the premise was something along the lines of what would happen if you combine a teenager's first vacation without parents with a group of vampires?

Some of you might say that sounds pretty interesting, but there were a few issues with this story that made it unfit for publication, leading to the story's abandonment. The first issue was the fact that I had a very low target word countsay half the size of an Unbound book, which is already quite smallmaking the book a [novelette](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word_count#In_fiction) at best. This is longer than a short story, but leads to the amount of space being, well, really small. I was having trouble cramming all the things I wanted in the available space.

The second problem was the lack of an outline. I wanted to see what happened if I tried [pantsing](http://www.wikiwrimo.org/wiki/Pantsing), and the results weren't pretty. The primary problem was pacing, things were not progressing in a way I would consider naturally.

A third and somewhat embarrassing outline was that every single writing session for this book [involved Scotch](/2014/1/30/no-scotch.html). This might have had some impact on the quality as well.

Finally, the story just wasn't very good. I read the first bit after I was about a quarter of the way in, and aside from feeling some nostalgia for the first I went on vacation without parents (to [Renesse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renesse)), the whole thing struck me as a bad ripoff of [The Lost Boys](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0093437/).

Would this book sell? I have no idea. Probably not, and I guess we'll never know. I'd suggest people to save their money and get a copy of The Lost Boys instead. It's a classic, has a 7.2 score on IMDB as of writing this, and it's one of my favorite vampire movies.
