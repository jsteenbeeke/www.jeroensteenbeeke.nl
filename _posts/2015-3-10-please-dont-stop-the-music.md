I wanted to make another Musical Inspiration post today, but apparently the Beatport embedded links don't seem to work with SSL anymore. I've e-mailed their support department, so maybe they'll be re-enabled soon.

For the time being, this means I can't do any musical inspiration posts, unless I post Youtube links. I'd rather not, since they've been unreliable in the past.
