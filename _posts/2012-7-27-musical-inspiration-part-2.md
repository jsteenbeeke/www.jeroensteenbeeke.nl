A while ago I posted a number of songs that help me focus while writing my books. I figured it was time to post a few more.

In most cases, songs I listen to inspire a general mood, though in many cases the lyrics are also meaningful to me in a way. With these two particular songs however, the words are strangely fitting to my novels (though not all of them may be quite obvious).

(By the way, this post was triggered by a coworker sending me a link to [&quot;I wanna be a Gabber Baby&quot; by DJ. Isaac](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX2fZJLH96M). Not recommended)
