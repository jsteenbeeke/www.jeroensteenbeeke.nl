For the past two weeks or so, I've barely spent any time on writing. I even missed my semi-regular end of the week blog post, for no other reason than not feeling like it. Lately, I've found I'm more likely to fire up [Factorio](https://www.factorio.com/), or to spend time coding when I should be writing instead. In addition, I keep postponing stuff I could have done by now.

It seems the word for this condition is lethargy: a lack of motivation and/or energy. It's not that I don't want to write, it's that whenever I have the time for it (which is often enough, fortunately), I feel as if it's too much effort.

**Blah blah blah, first world problems, nobody cares, quit whining.**

This is not a hard problem. I'm not trying to solve the [Riemann hypothesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riemann_hypothesis), I'm trying to get some words written in worlds and settings entirely of my own creation. It's already in my head, getting it out isn't that hard. I've done it before.

So let's go with a trusted formula: go to bed early, spend your Wednesday morning either editing, writing or outlining, and make sure your [task list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Getting_Things_Done) is empty by the end of the day, and the next time you're on a train with your laptop, you only start coding if you have absolutely nothing writing wise to do (which is rare).
