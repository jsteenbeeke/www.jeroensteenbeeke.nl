As some of you know, my e-books are available from a wide range of stores. Amazon, Barnes  Noble, Kobo, the iBookStore, Lulu and probably quite a few resellers of the previous. Most of these external stores are facilitated through Lulu.

My long-time readers will remember that I originally had a different cover for Gift of the Destroyer, that included the series title on the cover. As a result of this, I had to include the series title in the e-book title to get Lulu to distribute it to other vendors. For The Raven's Endgame, this was no problem, since it still has its original cover, but the new Gift of the Destroyer cover doesn't include the series title. Each time I revised Gift of the Destroyer, there was a 50% chance that Lulu would reject the changes due to &quot;incorrect metadata&quot; or something along the lines.

Today, I contacted their helpdesk to see if there was a way to fix the book title to reflect the updated cover. They told me it was impossible, and I had to completely remove the book from circulation and republish it. Quite a hassle, especially if you don't want to lose your rankings and reviews.

Well, &quot;fortunately&quot;, I don't think I have any of those on Lulu or their distributors - so the decision was easy - I delisted the books.

This got me thinking however. I could simply create a new e-book entry (complete with new ISBN) and start the process from scratch, but my sales for Lulu and affiliate distributors are not even a tenth of what I sell at Amazon, so I might as well not republish it and go with KDP Select again.

There's one problem with this: I still have the book available at Kobo and affiliates. So, I went ahead and checked my recent sales there: exactly zero. Of course, that doesn't mean much, so I checked my all-time sales: also zero. Result: I delisted from Kobo as well.

**So, what does this mean for you?**

The Raven's Endgamewill remain available from all my regular channels. Hunter's Chosen will be released on all these channels as well. However, Gift of the Destroyer will become Amazon exclusive for e-books. For the moment I think my books will remain available through a few more channels. Delisting takes a while to propagate. Once I'm enrolled in KDP Select. My e-books are DRM free on all channels. If you get it through Amazon you can simply use Calibre to convert it to your desired format.

Paper books will continue to be available from both Lulu and Amazon.
