A few weeks ago YouTube auto-suggested a channel I might like, namely [Adrian von Ziegler](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSeJA6az0GrNM4_-pl3HQSQ). In part due to the images, I checked it out, and was pleasantly surprised: lots and lots of Celtic-themed instrumental music that would go really well with writing fantasy.

Naturally, I wanted to share this music with you, and while I could have simply added YouTube links, I instead added the ability to embed Bandcamp fragments to my site.
