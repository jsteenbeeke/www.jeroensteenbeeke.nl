I often joke that I have too many hobbies. It's true, really, and the most obvious solution would be to drop a few and focus on the others. Sounds good in theory, but you decide which hobby you're going to drop, when you love them all equally. Part of the problem is a decrease in free time as a result of wanting to lose weight - I spend a lot more time playing [Dance Dance Revolution](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dance_Dance_Revolution) to burn extra calories (and it's working, I've lost over 9kg since I started). Additionally, there have been a lot of extra writing-related &quot;stuff that needs to be done&quot; kind of jobs, most of which are now completed.

Lately, I've been spending a lot of my free time doing extra writing. The fact that I have four books out and [six more planned](https://www.jeroensteenbeeke.nl/note-current-projects/) makes writing a very busy hobby indeed. A lot of people have writing as a full time job, and if it weren't for my daily commute by train, these books would take a whole lot longer, and I might have given up a long time ago.

Before my current writing binge, I spent a lot of free time doing video games. I have a giant list of games in my Steam account that I have yet to play, not counting the &quot;played but not yet finished&quot; list. One of these days I'll have to do those as well. Additionally, I'm part of a multiplayer gaming community known as [The Tysan Clan](http://www.tysanclan.com/), so I'm expected to make my appearance there as well, at least every now and then (which reduces time for other games).

But my most neglected hobby is [Warhammer 40K](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warhammer_40,000), a hobby which for many people takes up pretty much all the free time they have. I must admit I've only played a single game since the release of 6th Edition in 2012, and with my favorite hobby story dropping all Games Workshop products, I haven't been spending much time on this. This one pretty much outclasses all other hobbies when it comes to financial investments (though writing comes close), so it's not a hobby I'm eager to get rid of. But lately there have been a number of &quot;obstacles&quot; that meant I couldn't work on the hobby without spending an entire weekend on it (the short version: a rather ambitious conversion that required custom resin casts of a difficult component - I've now decided to not do this conversion and just assemble the models normally). I intend to do something about this neglect, as working with miniatures is very relaxing for me. Getting back into playing games might take a bit longer, with my regular store no longer a possible venue, I need to travel a bit farther to play a game.

Will this impact my writing? Probably not, but it will definitely be good for me.
