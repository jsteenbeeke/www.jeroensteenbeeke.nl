While browsing the Kindle Boards a while ago, I saw that fellow writer Michelle Muckley was looking for people to interview. After giving it some thought, I figured: sure, why not, and gave her my contact info. The [result can be found on her blog today](http://michellemuckley.blogspot.nl/2012/09/interview-with-jeroen-steenbeeke.html). So, if you have a few minutes to spare, go ahead and read. While you're there, you should also check out her book The Loss of Deference. I haven't finished reading it yet, but while it's quite different from the sort of books I usually read it's been a very intriguing read so far.
