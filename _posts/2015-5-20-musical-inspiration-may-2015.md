It seems like whenever I tune into [Digitally Imported](http://di.fm) I discover a bunch of new songs to listen to while writing. I used to only listen to one or two songs set on repeat, but right now I've got a playlist that's twice as long as my commute, and still growing.

A while ago I started listening to a bunch of songs made and/or remixed by Photographer, that tend to be a bit harder in sound than what I normally listen to (though the average Hardstyle or Hardcore listener will probably beg to differ). I featured the song Shelter by Dash Berlin and Roxanne Emery here [in February](/2015/2/4/musical-inspiration-february-2015.html).

Anyway, here's a bunch of songs by Photographer:
