A recurring theme on my blog is the Musical Inspiration category, where I tell about music I listen to while writing. More often than not, these posts involve Trance Music, which tend to be pretty long songs. Generally, they feature introductions that last anywhere between 1 and 3 minutes before you get to the good parts.

A good example is Crimson Soil by Hemstock and Jennings:

{% include youtube.html video="kaOLMHDL--E" %}

This song has a buildup of about 2 minutes before the vocals kick in, and it takes about 2 more minutes before the introductory vocals are over and the main segment of the song starts.

Another example is the Photon Project remix of Andain's Beautiful Things:

{% include youtube.html video="c40Cimu2BJE" %}

Here you have a 2 and a half minute introduction before you get to the vocals, and another minute before the refrain starts.

**I really REALLY hate this**

The buildups of these songs generally only feature percussion, and the parts I like take a long time to arrive. Worse still, many of these songs also have long outro sequences. If you're playing these songs as part of a playlist, this generally means you're listening to fragments you do not like for at least half the time. Not a good thing when you're writing and using the music as a mood enhancer.



Generally, I deal with this in one of two ways:

**Shorter remix**
Many songs I like come in various remixes, and more often than not, there is a radio edit that features all the good features, but without the long intro and outro sequences. This is not always the case, however.

**Trim the song**
All it takes is a few minutes and a program like [Audacity](http://audacity.sourceforge.net/) to take out the parts I don't like and leave only the good stuff (assuming of course that fair use laws in your country allow this).
