This is probably going to result in a few hundred 404 errors in my website log, but I just finished rearranging the categories of my posts. The categories I had were pretty meaningless, and not very well defined.

As of today, this site has 5 categories:

<!--more-->* Announcements - Important stuff such as book releases, interviews and promotions
* Writing - Anything that relates to writing my own books, or writing in general
* Reading - Reflections on books I read, including guest posts by other authors about books I have read
* Real Life Stuff - Things I did and experienced in the real world that do not directly relate to writing
* Opinions - My opinions about things happening in the real world. Might be related to writing, but not directly to my own work
