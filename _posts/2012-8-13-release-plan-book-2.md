A little over two months ago, I finished the first draft of my second novel. This was quite a happy moment for me, as it proved that writing a book was something I could do more than once, even when [forced to start over due to a derailed plot line](https://www.jeroensteenbeeke.nl/31k-word-cut/). I feel my writing has improved since I wrote Gift of the Destroyer, and I hope people will enjoy my second book as much as they enjoyed the first.

**So when is it coming out?**

Unfortunately, I can't give an exact date yet, as the release date depends on the work of a number of other people, whose schedules may not fit perfectly with mine. The second book is currently being edited, and I expect feedback by the end of the week, but I have no idea how much work this will entail. I expect to have a &quot;release candidate&quot; by the end of the month, which will go a final two week review by a number of beta readers to find the last few errors. In addition, I can't release the book until I receive the cover art. Mike Gauss is currently working on a new cover for Gift of the Destroyer, and will start work on the cover for book 2 after that is completed.

My current estimate is a release by the end of September, or early October. This is more or less what I've been saying for the past few months, but again, I can't guarantee anything.

**So what's the title?**

Yeah, I'm not telling yet. Remember [what happened the last time](https://www.jeroensteenbeeke.nl/title-fail/)?
