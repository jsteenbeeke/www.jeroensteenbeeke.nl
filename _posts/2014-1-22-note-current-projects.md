I often refer to books by number on Twitter, and yesterday I realized this might be a bit confusing for people. This post is meant to clarify the numbering on stuff I'm working on. I'll update this post as I continue writing new stuff. Basically, the books are numbered in the order in which I finished (or intend to finish) writing them.

My books generally go through the following stages:
* Idea - Not yet an actual story, but has the potential to become on
* Conceptual - Some backstory and plot realized, at least some of it on paper
* Outlined - Has a completed story sequence, can start writing whenever I feel like it
* Writing - Currently in the process of writing it
* First draft - All chapters written
* Second / Alpha reading draft - Story checked, descriptions polished, book gets sent to alpha readers
* Third draft - Feedback from Alpha readers processed
* Fourth / Editor draft - Book re-read, polished, checked with automated tool, ready to send to editor
* Fifth / Beta reading draft - Editor's feedback processed, ready to send to beta readers
* Final version - Beta reader feedback processed, cover ready
* Published - Front matter added, ebooks formatted, uploaded to one or more vendor
