In ony of my previous musical inspiration posts I mentioned that I often listen to Celtic Music while writing fantasy. To my own surprise, I've never done a spotlight on this before (at least, I can't remember it, nor can I find a musical post that mentions such music).

I'm not entirely sure if the term Celtic Music is even correct, as many of the bands, singers and groups I listen to can be classified in a number of different genres. But anyway, here's a number of songs that tend to feature heavily in my playlists:

{% include youtube.html video="20akrOZr3mo" %}

{% include youtube.html video="0SG6ZITbWpU" %}

{% include youtube.html video="rJskU0nkv4w" %}

{% include youtube.html video="tL9KWB0M4UU" %}

{% include youtube.html video="4YhqHR1JIVg" %}

Come to think of it, I could probably list half a dozen more. Better save those for next time.

If you have any suggestions for stuff I should listen to while writing, let me know!
