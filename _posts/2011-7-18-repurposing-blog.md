Ok, I admit, my spellchecker is throwing a fit over the title of this post, but as a fantasy writer I reserve the right to invent new words. A little creativity never hurts right?

As I'm sure some people have noticed, I haven't been writing many blog posts lately. Some might even wonder why this is so, seeing as I often tend to have something about my writing experience to share. There are of course several reasons for this.

<!--more-->
First of all, I have been writing less often lately, mostly due to catching up on George R.R. Martin's books. I finished reading the first 4 novels three weeks ago, did some writing work in between, and started reading again when A Dance with Dragons was released (just over 60% now). The effort required to boot my Kindle is considerably less than the effort required to boot my netbook, so this is not helping.

Second of all, I am having trouble thinking of writing-related topics to blog about. I can offer some advice on writing (mostly gained through experience), as well as elaborate on stuff I read on other writing-related blogs, but this isn't really my strength nor my preference.

Third, and most importantly: I feel I'm going about this blogging thing all wrong. I started this website after reading lots of mention of writers having to &quot;build a platform&quot; to attract readers. Ask yourself this, am I attracting readers by writing about how to write? Most readers don't care unless they're writers themselves (a really small subset). I know a number of people who do really well by blogging about their writing process, such as [Lydia Sharp](http://lydiasharp.blogspot.com/). On the other hand, most established writers who are active bloggers write about anything they feel like (for instance: [John Scalzi](http://whatever.scalzi.com/), whose aptly named blog Whatever illustrates this). This may include writing, but usually it doesn't. And then there's the real fanatics such as [self-styled self-publishing guru Joe Konrath](http://jakonrath.blogspot.com/), but he's a category all by himself.

So, I already have a blog in place, but I'm not satisfied with it just being about writing, so I'm giving it a new purpose: I'm going to write about whatever I feel like whether it's about writing or not, provided it doesn't fit in a tweet or two. I'll still post writing updates when I feel like it, but that will no longer be the primary purpose of this blog.

Also, on a slightly unrelated note, I'll be replacing my current layout with a new one as soon as I find or make one suitable. I'm no longer satisfied with this one.

So, how do you guys feel about these changes?
