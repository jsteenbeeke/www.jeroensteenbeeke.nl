Some questions do not have simply answers. This can get a bit frustrating when you're using Twitter, as your messages are limited to a 140 characters. Fortunately, I have a website that allows me to give longer answers to those questions.�In this particular case, the [cause of this post ](http://twitter.com/#!/judyblackcloud/status/135819345384308736)was a message by [@judyblackcloud](http://twitter.com/#!/judyblackcloud) asking us what words inspire us.

Well, where to start? I can communicate to some extent in 5 languages (assuming we consider Low Saxon to be a separate language and not a Dutch dialect), and know a variety of words in about 5 more languages. But those are words I *know*, not necessarily words that inspire me.

Words that truly inspire me are words that are part of a greater whole, words that trigger associations with elements of the story I am working on. Examples of these are words such as *fealty*, and *liege lord,*which are bound to show up in a fantasy world that is largely medieval in setting. But my inspiration is not limited to feudal terms. The word *embrace*I also find inspiring, as it describes an action that involves at least two people, and can used in subtly different ways to mean different ways. An embrace can mean a hug, but also something more private (incidentally, the first chapter of [Gift of the Destroyer](https://www.jeroensteenbeeke.nl/novels/) is called Lover's Embrace), or something peculiar to the world you are writing about (for instance, in certain vampire stories, an embrace is the act of turning another person into a vampire).

But in many cases, words that inspire me are words that simply sound good to me. Good example are the words�*anthem, heart*and *evasion*. In many cases such words sound better than they do in my native language (Dutch), such as *eye*(as opposed to Dutch &quot;oog*&quot;*). But others I simply find pleasing to hear without comparing them to Dutch (or English for that matter), such as: *ayla* (Hebrew for &quot;Oak Tree&quot;, Turkish for &quot;Moonlight&quot; - well sort of), *nrmre* (Swedish for &quot;closer&quot;), *rst* (Swedish for &quot;voice&quot;), *Heimat* (German for &quot;homeland&quot;), *invictus* (Latin for someone who is invincible), *corona* (Latin for crown) and�*Bealtaine*(Irish festival in May). A great way to find out about such words is to listen to foreign music by the way.
