Music plays a great part in getting me in the right mood to write. Usually, I listen to [Trance music](/2014/1/14/anthem.html), but every now and then I switch to different musical genres. I might listen to [video game music](/2013/11/29/musical-inspiration-video-games.html), [Emma Hewitt](/2012/11/12/musical-inspiration-emma-hewitt.html) or Celtic Folk music (huh, I never did a post about that?).

A recent addition to this list are two songs by Ellie Goulding (the second of which is from the Divergent soundtrack, hence the movie images):

{% include youtube.html video="CGyEd0aKWZE" %}

{% include youtube.html video="wrNTOo4KH8c" %}

Funny fact about this is that they were suggestions by YouTube next to a Trance song (though I can't quite remember which one at the moment).
