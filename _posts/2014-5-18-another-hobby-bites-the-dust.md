Last Friday, I received a newsletter from one of the many sites I use to buy Warhammer 40K supplies, in which they discussed the imminent release of a new edition of Warhammer 40K, and how that would impact orders from their site.

The mail by itself wasn't all that unusual. This site sends updates on a regular basis, and around a new edition things can get a bit hectic. The unusual thing about this whole thing is the fact that Games Workshop is releasing a new edition so soon after the previous one.

I started playing Warhammer 40K shortly after the release of 5th edition in 2008. I've never been especially good at the game, though I did manage to get a reasonable build for that particular edition. When they released the 6th edition in 2012, they pretty much torpedoed the core of my build, so I had to buy a whole bunch of new miniatures to switch to a different build that was more viable. I did buy quite a few of them, but due to a number of personal reasons, never really got around to it. In fact, I've played only 1 or 2 game since they released the 6th Edition, which was less than two years ago. And now they're again releasing a new edition.

This whole thing got me thinking. I really love working with and painting miniatures, but I never really got into the gaming side of Warhammer 40K. Adding to that is the fact that it's difficult for me to find opponents. One nearby store stopped selling Games Workshop products entirely, and the other has seriously downsized their gaming space due to lack of interest. There are some 40K players still around, but their schedules are either as erratic as mine, or they are so far beyond me skill-wise that it's a certain loss (those games can be both fun and educational, but I'd like to at least stand a chance of winning).

So now I have a pretty large collection of miniatures I never use. If I ever do want to use them, it will require a significant investment of both money and time. I'm already lacking time as it is, and I'm not going to spend more money on a new rulebook when I barely used the old one.

For these reasons, I've decided to quit playing Warhammer 40K altogether, and have placed [my entire collection on Marktplaats](http://www.marktplaats.nl/a/hobby-en-vrije-tijd/warhammer-en-wargaming/m810923542-grote-eldar-collectie.html?previousPage=lr) (a Dutch company owned by Ebay).

Please note that this isn't in any way meant to be a rant against Games Workshop (though I do think they're crazy for releasing new rules so soon). This is a personal decision, which I've been contemplating for some time, but for which GW's update has been a catalyst.

And the good news, for me at least, is that I'll still be getting my miniature painting fix. I have a dozen or two miniatures that I use for Dungeons  Dragons, and I can always use a few more. But in this case it's entirely in my own hands, without any corporate pressure for me to spend more money.
