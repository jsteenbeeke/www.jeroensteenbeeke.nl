**Disclaimer: Do not read this article if you are sensitive to profanity**
Remember that article I wrote a few weeks ago about [harassment policies and conventions](https://www.jeroensteenbeeke.nl/harassment-conventions/)? That article is just one small piece of a larger trend that has been going on for the past few months, with many Science Fiction and Fantasy authors speaking out against marginalization and harassment of woman involved in all things SFF. This is not limited to conventions, but to anything, really, a rallying cry for respectful treatment of women involved in Science Fiction and Fantasy. A rallying cry that shouldn't be necessary, but apparently is.

There are a few people out there who feel threatened by this trend, who feel that women who speak out against being harassed should be put in place. For the sake of convenience (and because I really, REALLY think these people should die in a fire), I will refer to them as assholes for the remainder of this article, because in my opinion, they simply are.

Yesterday I noticed a message on John Scalzi's blog about [a lawsuit threat](http://whatever.scalzi.com/2014/02/16/a-note-to-sean-fodera/). There is an asshole named Sean Fodera who is apparently a Science Fiction writer, and has been writing a rather incendiary article about fantasy writer and Hugo Award winner [Mary Robinette Kowal](http://www.maryrobinettekowal.com/), and now threatening over 1200 people with lawsuits for quoting him verbatim. I could explain the whole thing here, of course, but there are very good summaries on both [The Daily Dot](http://www.dailydot.com/lifestyle/sfwa-sexism-sci-fi-nebulas-mary-kowal/) and [Popehat](http://www.popehat.com/2014/02/17/science-fiction-community-generates-this-weekends-bufoonish-defamation-threat/).

Wait, let's go back one step there: he's threatening to sue them for libel, over a *verbatim* quote? Now I'm no lawyer, and my knowledge of US laws isn't exactly in-depth, but I'm pretty sure he's got about a snowball's chance in hell of that working out. Now, I'm not sure if he's heard of the [Streisand Effect](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streisand_Effect), but he'll soon be intimately familiar with it.

Oh, and Sean, in the unlikely event that you're reading this and are considering adding me to the list: I'm not subject to American laws, so good luck with that.
