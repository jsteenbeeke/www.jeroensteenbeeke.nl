Last Monday, after several months of editing and refining the work, I have released my second novel: the Raven's Endgame. The Raven's Endgame takes place approximately 35 years after the events of Gift of the Destroyer
> Across the world, the dream of every Seer is the same: a great wall of flame consuming everything within sight. In the midst of all this, a young girl wakes up in an alley in Chaedin. She does not know her origins. She does not know her name. But she has the same dream, and she knows that she is the only one who can stop it from happening.

<!--more-->The Raven's Endgame is currently available as e-book only:

* [The Raven's Endgame at Lulu.com](http://www.lulu.com/shop/jeroen-steenbeeke/the-ravens-endgame/ebook/product-20395945.html)

In addition to these stores, I will also be offering it for sale at Barnes and Noble and the iBookStore, but these will take a few more days and/or weeks to clear. In addition, a print version will be available from Lulu in a few weeks.

In other news, I have released a new version of Gift of the Destroyer, with updated artwork (by [Michael Gauss](http://gaussianeffect.blogspot.com/)) and another round of editing to improve the quality of the text. You'd think I'd get the hang of English one of these days :-)

Again, BN and the iBookStore might take a while to update
