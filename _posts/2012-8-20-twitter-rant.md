Twitter can be a strange place sometimes. I've been on Twitter with my [@JeroenFM](http://twitter.com/JeroenFM) account for quite a while now, since November 2009. In June last year I created my [@JSteenbeeke](http://twitter.com/JSteenbeeke) account, primarily to stop bothering friends and co-workers with writing-related tweets (and to follow back other writers without clogging up my main timeline). Those that did want to read my writing news simply followed both accounts. Overall, I think my experience with Twitter has been pleasant.

What it doesn't do well, is help authors sell books. I base this opinion both on my own experiences, and on anecdotal evidence from the people at the Kindleboards. My @JSteenbeeke account currently has about 100 followers. The vast majority of those followers are fellow writers. Not readers, writers. Most of those writers I do not follow back. If I did, my timeline would be a wall of book advertisements.

My efforts of book promotion to Twitter have resulted in a total of 3 sales, and perhaps a number of free downloads when I was participating in KDP Select. Those 3 sales were through Smashwords, when I offered 50% off with a coupon. I know exactly who bought those copies, as two of them were co-workers, and one was a friend of a friend.

So, Twitter hasn't helped me sell that many books, and many writers agree Twitter isn't an effective tool to reach new readers. It's not that hard to figure out why: when you're looking at Twitter, are you looking for stuff to buy? Or are you looking for interesting tidbits of information and/or images? If a person you are following does nothing more than tweet &quot;buy my book&quot;, does it invite you to buy the book, or to unfollow the author? In my case, the latter.

If an author starts following me on Twitter, a number of things can happen:
* If it's the @JeroenFM account, I ignore them. Hollywood principle: don't call me, I'll call you. If I like an author enough to have them show up in my &quot;main&quot; timeline I'll do the following myself
*    If it's the @JSteenbeeke account, it depends on who you are and what you tweet:     * If your description contains only the information that you are a writer and links to your book, you get ignored.     * If you do nothing but tweet about your books and/or reviews of your books, you get ignored     * If you are a quirky person who writes interesting tweets and occasionally mention your books, I *might*follow yo

To make a long story short: don't spam your books on Twitter. You're not buying other people's books that way, so why should someone else.

Ok, enough for now, rant over
