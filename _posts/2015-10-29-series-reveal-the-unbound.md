As you might know, it's been a while since I've released any new books, with the last two being released in 2013. I haven't been idle, working on a series of Urban Fantasy novellas that take place in my home region of Twente, in the east of the Netherlands. It started as a side project, but has taken almost two years to finish. I've mentioned this project a number of times, mostly referring to the individual books as book 5, book 6, etcetera, without going into details. Those of you who are aware of my [a note on current projects](/2014/1/22/note-current-projects.html) post will have some idea of what I was referring to, and I imagine a lot of my Twitter followers having grown tired of book 8 is coming along nicely.

Well enough of that! The project is nearing completion, so it's time I reveal what all this has been about:

**Book description**

*I used to think I was a pretty normal teenager: I got up in the morning,*
*went to school, did my homework, played videogames, and dreamed about*
*Karen&#x2014;one of the girls in my class. When I found out she liked me, too, I*
*thought I was the luckiest guy alive. But everything changed when we kissed.*
*Something awakened inside of us, and now we know that we’re not normal*
*teenagers after all.*

*For a while I thought these powers were pretty amazing&#x2014;I mean, who*
*wouldn’t want superpowers? But it stopped being fun when Karen started*
*hearing a voice in her head. A voice that told her I was her enemy. A voice that*
*could take control of her. A voice that was only the first glimpse of a world we*
*never knew existed.*
