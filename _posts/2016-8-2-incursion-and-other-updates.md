Yes, I'm still here, it's just been a little hard keeping up with my regular blog schedule, [as I explained earlier](/2016/6/16/offspring-induced-blog-schedule-interruption.html). Here's a small update on the state of things:

1. I've gotten feedback on [Incursion](/2016/3/24/incursion-and-the-road-ahead.html) from two of my three alpha readers. Once all this feedback is processed, I'll be sending it out for editing

<!--more-->1. I've steadily been increasing the [backstory wiki](/2016/6/20/control-your-story-background-use-a-wiki.html) for my epic fantasy project. I've gotten most of the key concepts written down. Once this is done I'll detail the history of the setting, and after that I'll work on character bios before proceeding to the actual outline. This is the first time I've spent this much effort on fleshing out the backstory, and I had expected to be done sooner.
1. I'm contemplating starting a secondary blog for programming projects I work on as a hobby. I have no idea if this will have much of an audience, but it definitely doesn't belong on this blog.

So there you have it!
