Today I have something special for you guys.

As most of you know, I really like using Twitter. It is a perfect tool to get in touch with all sorts of interesting people. Using Twitter, I got in touch with fellow writer [Andi Judy](https://twitter.com/Judyblackcloud), who runs a blog containing all sorts of interesting writer's advice, with the occasional personal piece. Because I really enjoy reading her blog and Twitter feed, and because she also likes fantasy, I asked her to do a guest post, to which she happily agreed.

--&gt;Epic fantasy is what really got me into reading and was what I first started writing. I dove through fantasy novels, checking out almost every single one in our library at school, and planning out my own trilogy series.

But one issue I have had over and over with epic fantasy series is characters. Characters seem to fall out of the sky and by the end of the second chapter I have 16 characters and no idea who anyone is. Maybe its just me, but I need time to figure out who the character is, what they want, etc. so that I remember them. There needs to be something about them that makes me remember, Oh, yes! Thats the one whos an archer and betrayed the king as opposed to Nowwas that the one with the bow or the magic? Waitwho is that?

Having a lot of characters is not a bad thing. It can be done very well, with each character having a distinct identity so that I know who they all are and care about each of them. But it can also be done very poorly where I dont know who the characters are, and, honestly, dont care about any of them. Thats usually the moment I put the book down and find something else to occupy myself with.

How can you keep your characters from becoming a muddled mess? Well, for one, have strong characters. Dont (like I did the first time I wrote a fantasy story) throw in a character for the sole purpose of killing them later. The reader will know that you havent put a lot of time into that character and their death wont serve as the shock youd planned on.

Another very, very simple way to help your reader keep their characters straight is with their names. I know, ridiculously simple, but if Im reading about Mary and Maryl wandering the city Im going to get a bit confused with their names. Now, maybe you can still make them distinctive enough as characters, but do you really want to take a chance of confusing the reader? Why not Mary and Baryl? Similar sounds still, but at the very first letter I know which character Im reading about. Readers can be lazy, make it easy for them. I try to have all of my characters names start with a different letter so that at any moment, the reader knows who Im talking about by the first letter of their name.

Third, be careful with nicknames. If your hero is called Hammer by his army, thats great, if hes called Hammer by one character in one scene with no solid connectionthats not so good. If hes called Hammer by his army Blade by his friends and Prince by his followers. thats very bad and very confusing for a reader. Try to stick with one name per character. Shorten names, give them nicknames, do whatever, but make sure that its clear who that nickname belongs to when its used.

And thats the best, most simple advice I can think of when it comes to helping keep your characters from blurring together to readers. What else can you all think of?
